/**
 * Generates the blocks and power-ups for each level.
 * 
 * This class is well designed because of its flexibility -- new levels can be
 * added to the game without changing the level factory code at all. As long as
 * the .properties file contains the necessary level data (namely, the number of
 * each block type and power-up type present in the level), the level factory
 * will assign the blocks and power-ups to random positions.
 * 
 * In addition to being flexible to new levels, the factory is flexible to new
 * types of blocks and power-ups. To add a new power-up or block, we need only
 * update and add the relevant lines in the .properties file, and the level
 * factory will happily place them for us.
